# Pull Request Check List

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.  Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.  But please read our [contribution guide](https://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) at least once, it will save you unnecessary review cycles!

- [ ] Added **tests** for changed code.
- [ ] New features have been added to our [Hypothesis testing strategy](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/blob/master/tests/utils.py).
- [ ] Updated **documentation** for changed code.
- [ ] Documentation in `.rst` files is written using [semantic newlines](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/).
- [ ] Changed/added classes/methods/functions have appropriate `versionadded`, `versionchanged`, or `deprecated` [directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/para.html#directive-versionadded).
- [ ] Changes (and possible deprecations) are documented in [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst).

If you have *any* questions to *any* of the points above, just **submit and ask**!  This checklist is here to *help* you, not to deter you from contributing!

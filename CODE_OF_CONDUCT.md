# Code of Conduct

While not being a [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/) project, everyone interacting in this project is expected to follow the [PSF Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/).

In general, this means that everyone is expected to be **open**, **considerate**, and **respectful** of others no matter what their position is within the project.


## Enforcement

We take Code of Conduct violations seriously, and will act to ensure our spaces are welcoming, inclusive, and professional environments to communicate in.

If you need to raise a Code of Conduct report, you may do so privately by email to [Hynek Schlawack](mailto:hs@ox.cx).

Reports will be treated confidentially.

Class-level `kw_only=True` behavior is now consistent with `dataclasses`.

Previously, a class that sets `kw_only=True` makes all attributes keyword-only,
including those from base classes.  If an attribute sets `kw_only=False`, that
setting is ignored, and it is still made keyword-only.

Now, only the attributes defined in that class that doesn't explicitly set
`kw_only=False` are made keyword-only.

This shouldn't be a problem for most users, unless you have a pattern like this:

```python
@attrs.define(kw_only=True)
class Base:
    a: int
    b: int = attrs.field(default=1, kw_only=False)

@attrs.define
class Subclass(Base):
    c: int
```

Here, we have a `kw_only=True` attrs class (`Base`) with an attribute that sets
`kw_only=False` and has a default (`Base.b`), and then create a subclass (`Subclass`)
with required arguments (`Subclass.c`).  Previously this would work, since it
would make `Base.b` keyword-only, but now this fails since `Base.b` is positional, and
we have a required positional argument (`Subclass.c`) following another argument with
defaults.

Fixed serialization behavior of non-slots classes with ``cache_hash=True``.
The hash cache will be cleared on operations which make "deep copies" of instances of classes with hash caching,
though the cache will not be cleared with shallow copies like those made by ``copy.copy()``.

Previously, ``copy.deepcopy()`` or serialization and deserialization with ``pickle`` would result in an un-initialized object.

This change also allows the creation of ``cache_hash=True`` classes with a custom ``__setstate__``,
which was previously forbidden (`#494 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/494>`_).

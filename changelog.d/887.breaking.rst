``import attrs`` has finally landed!
As of this release, you can finally import ``attrs`` using its proper name.

Not all names from the ``attr`` namespace have been transferred; most notably ``attr.s`` and ``attr.ib`` are missing.
See ``attrs.define`` and ``attrs.field`` if you haven't seen our next-generation APIs yet.
A more elaborate explanation can be found `On The Core API Names <https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html>`_

This feature is at least for one release **provisional**.
We don't *plan* on changing anything, but such a big change is unlikely to go perfectly on the first strike.

The API docs have been mostly updated, but it will be an ongoing effort to change everything to the new APIs.
Please note that we have **not** moved -- or even removed -- anything from ``attr``!

Please do report any bugs or documentation inconsistencies!

**Provisional** APIs called ``attr.define()``, ``attr.mutable()``, and ``attr.frozen()`` have been added.

They are only available on Python 3.6 and later, and call ``attr.s()`` with different default values.

If nothing comes up, they will become the official way for creating classes in 20.2.0 (see above).

The ``cmp`` argument to ``attr.s()`` and ``attr.ib()`` is now deprecated.

Please use ``eq`` to add equality methods (``__eq__`` and ``__ne__``) and ``order`` to add ordering methods (``__lt__``, ``__le__``, ``__gt__``, and ``__ge__``) instead, like with `dataclasses <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.

Since this is arguably a deeper backward-compatibilty break, it will have an extended deprecation period until 2021-06-01.
After that day, the ``cmp`` argument will be removed.

``attr.Attribute`` also isn't orderable anymore.

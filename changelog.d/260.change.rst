``attrs``-decoratorated classes are never modified now.
Instead a new class is created with the appropriated methods and attributes attached from the get go.

The previous (incorrect) behavior of hashing by object ID on Python 3 when passing ``@attr.s(hash=False)`` (which implies ``cmp=True``), is retained  for backward compatibility reasons.

A better -- and more explicit -- way to control object hashing is in the pipeline.

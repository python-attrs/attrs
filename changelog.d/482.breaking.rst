Fixed a bug where deserialized objects with ``cache_hash=True`` could have incorrect hash code values.
This change breaks classes with ``cache_hash=True`` when a custom ``__setstate__`` is present.
An exception will be thrown when applying the ``attrs`` annotation to such a class.
This limitation is tracked in issue https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/494 .

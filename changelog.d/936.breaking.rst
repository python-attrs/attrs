Python 2.7 is not supported anymore.

Dealing with Python 2.7 tooling has become too difficult for a volunteer-run project.

We have supported Python 2 more than 2 years after it was officially discontinued and feel that we have paid our dues.
All version up to 21.4.0 from December 2021 remain fully functional, of course.

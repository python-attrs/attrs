Less of a deprecation and more of a heads up: the next release of ``attrs`` will introduce an ``attrs`` namespace.
That means that you'll finally be able to run ``import attrs`` with new functions that aren't cute abbreviations and that will carry better defaults.

This should not break any of your code, because project-local packages have priority before installed ones.
If this is a problem for you for some reason, please report it to our bug tracker and we'll figure something out.

The old ``attr`` namespace isn't going anywhere and its defaults are not changing â€“ this is a purely additive measure.
Please check out the linked issue for more details.

These new APIs have been added *provisionally* as part of `#666 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/pull/666>`_ so you can try them out today and provide feedback.
Learn more in the `API docs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#provisional-apis>`_.

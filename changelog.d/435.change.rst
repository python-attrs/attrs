Added ``comparator`` to ``Attribute`` and ``attr.ib()`` (`#435 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/435>`_).

``comparator`` must be a class that wraps a value and implements equality and ordering methods.

This change was motivated by the fact that some popular packages (``pandas dataframes``,
``numpy arrays``) overload equality and ordering methods to return values that are not boolean,
which makes sense in their specific domains (data science), but breaks generic functions
that rely on the protocol ``__eq__(self, other) -> bool``.

Under this change, the user will be able to specify *how* an ``Attribute`` is compared by
supplying a *comparison class*.

This change will also allow users to customize ``Attribute`` comparison in more
intuitive scenarios, e.g. *case insensitive strings*, or simply using a sort-like *key*
as requested in (`#624 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/624>`_).

Finally, we provide a few off-the-shelf ``comparator`` classes in the package ``attr.comparators``
that users can use in the most common cases, or use as template to implement their own.

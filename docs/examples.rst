Examples
========


Basics
------

The simplest possible usage would be:

.. doctest::

   >>> import attr
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class Empty(object):
   ...     pass
   >>> Empty()
   Empty()
   >>> Empty() == Empty()
   True
   >>> Empty() is Empty()
   False

So in other words: ``attrs`` is useful even without actual attributes!

But you'll usually want some data on your classes, so let's add some:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class Coordinates(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   ...     y = attr.ib()

By default, all features are added, so you immediately have a fully functional data class with a nice ``repr`` string and comparison methods.

.. doctest::

   >>> c1 = Coordinates(1, 2)
   >>> c1
   Coordinates(x=1, y=2)
   >>> c2 = Coordinates(x=2, y=1)
   >>> c2
   Coordinates(x=2, y=1)
   >>> c1 == c2
   False

As shown, the generated ``__init__`` method allows for both positional and keyword arguments.

If playful naming turns you off, ``attrs`` comes with serious business aliases:

.. doctest::

   >>> from attr import attrs, attrib
   >>> @attrs
   ... class SeriousCoordinates(object):
   ...     x = attrib()
   ...     y = attrib()
   >>> SeriousCoordinates(1, 2)
   SeriousCoordinates(x=1, y=2)
   >>> attr.fields(Coordinates) == attr.fields(SeriousCoordinates)
   True

For private attributes, ``attrs`` will strip the leading underscores for keyword arguments:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     _x = attr.ib()
   >>> C(x=1)
   C(_x=1)

If you want to initialize your private attributes yourself, you can do that too:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     _x = attr.ib(init=False, default=42)
   >>> C()
   C(_x=42)
   >>> C(23)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)

An additional way (not unlike ``characteristic``) of defining attributes is supported too.
This is useful in times when you want to enhance classes that are not yours (nice ``__repr__`` for Django models anyone?):

.. doctest::

   >>> class SomethingFromSomeoneElse(object):
   ...     def __init__(self, x):
   ...         self.x = x
   >>> SomethingFromSomeoneElse = attr.s(these={"x": attr.ib()}, init=False)(SomethingFromSomeoneElse)
   >>> SomethingFromSomeoneElse(1)
   SomethingFromSomeoneElse(x=1)

Or if you want to use properties:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s(these={"_x": attr.ib()})
   ... class ReadOnlyXSquared(object):
   ...    @property
   ...    def x(self):
   ...       return self._x ** 2
   >>> rox = ReadOnlyXSquared(x=5)
   >>> rox
   ReadOnlyXSquared(_x=5)
   >>> rox.x
   25
   >>> rox.x = 6
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   AttributeError: can't set attribute

`Sub-classing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_ is bad for you, but ``attrs`` will still do what you'd hope for:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class A(object):
   ...     a = attr.ib()
   ...     def get_a(self):
   ...         return self.a
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class B(object):
   ...     b = attr.ib()
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(B, A):
   ...     c = attr.ib()
   >>> i = C(1, 2, 3)
   >>> i
   C(a=1, b=2, c=3)
   >>> i == C(1, 2, 3)
   True
   >>> i.get_a()
   1

The order of the attributes is defined by the `MRO <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`_.

In Python 3, classes defined within other classes are `detected <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3155/>`_ and reflected in the ``__repr__``.
In Python 2 though, it's impossible.
Therefore ``@attr.s`` comes with the ``repr_ns`` option to set it manually:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     @attr.s(repr_ns="C")
   ...     class D(object):
   ...         pass
   >>> C.D()
   C.D()

``repr_ns`` works on both Python 2 and 3.
On Python 3 it overrides the implicit detection.


Converting to Dictionaries
--------------------------

When you have a class with data, it often is very convenient to transform that class into a :class:`dict` (for example if you want to serialize it to JSON):

.. doctest::

   >>> attr.asdict(Coordinates(x=1, y=2))
   {'y': 2, 'x': 1}

Some fields cannot or should not be transformed.
For that, :func:`attr.asdict` offers a callback that decides whether an attribute should be included:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class UserList(object):
   ...     users = attr.ib()
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class User(object):
   ...     email = attr.ib()
   ...     password = attr.ib()
   >>> attr.asdict(UserList([User("jane@doe.invalid", "s33kred"),
   ...                       User("joe@doe.invalid", "p4ssw0rd")]),
   ...             filter=lambda attr, value: attr.name != "password")
   {'users': [{'email': 'jane@doe.invalid'}, {'email': 'joe@doe.invalid'}]}

For the common case where you want to :func:`include <attr.filters.include>` or :func:`exclude <attr.filters.exclude>` certain types or attributes, ``attrs`` ships with a few helpers:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class User(object):
   ...     login = attr.ib()
   ...     password = attr.ib()
   ...     id = attr.ib()
   >>> attr.asdict(User("jane", "s33kred", 42),
   ...                  filter=attr.filters.exclude(attr.by_name(User, "password"), int))
   {'login': 'jane'}
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   ...     y = attr.ib()
   ...     z = attr.ib()
   >>> attr.asdict(C("foo", "2", 3),
   ...             filter=attr.filters.include(int, attr.by_name(C, "x")))
   {'z': 3, 'x': 'foo'}


Defaults
--------

Sometimes you want to have default values for your initializer.
And sometimes you even want mutable objects as default values (ever used accidentally ``def f(arg=[])``?).
``attrs`` has you covered in both cases:

.. doctest::

   >>> import collections
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class Connection(object):
   ...     socket = attr.ib()
   ...     @classmethod
   ...     def connect(cls, db_string):
   ...        # ... connect somehow to db_string ...
   ...        return cls(socket=42)
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class ConnectionPool(object):
   ...     db_string = attr.ib()
   ...     pool = attr.ib(default=attr.Factory(collections.deque))
   ...     debug = attr.ib(default=False)
   ...     def get_connection(self):
   ...         try:
   ...             return self.pool.pop()
   ...         except IndexError:
   ...             if self.debug:
   ...                 print("New connection!")
   ...             return Connection.connect(self.db_string)
   ...     def free_connection(self, conn):
   ...         if self.debug:
   ...             print("Connection returned!")
   ...         self.pool.appendleft(conn)
   ...
   >>> cp = ConnectionPool("postgres://localhost")
   >>> cp
   ConnectionPool(db_string='postgres://localhost', pool=deque([]), debug=False)
   >>> conn = cp.get_connection()
   >>> conn
   Connection(socket=42)
   >>> cp.free_connection(conn)
   >>> cp
   ConnectionPool(db_string='postgres://localhost', pool=deque([Connection(socket=42)]), debug=False)

Validators
----------

Although your initializers should be as dumb as possible, it can come in handy to do some kind of validation on the arguments.
That's when :func:`attr.ib`\ â€™s ``validator`` argument comes into play.
A validator is simply a callable that takes three arguments:

#. the *instance* that's being validated,
#. the *attribute* that it's validating, and finally
#. the *value* that is passed for it.

If the value does not pass the validator's standards, it just raises an appropriate exception.
Since the validator runs *after* the instance is initialized, you can refer to other attributes while validating :

.. doctest::

   >>> def x_smaller_than_y(instance, attribute, value):
   ...     if value >= instance.y:
   ...         raise ValueError("'x' has to be smaller than 'y'!")
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib(validator=x_smaller_than_y)
   ...     y = attr.ib()
   >>> C(x=3, y=4)
   C(x=3, y=4)
   >>> C(x=4, y=3)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   ValueError: 'x' has to be smaller than 'y'!

``attrs`` won't intercept your changes to those attributes but you can always call :func:`attr.validate` on any instance to verify that it's still valid:

.. doctest::

   >>> i = C(4, 5)
   >>> i.x = 5  # works, no magic here
   >>> attr.validate(i)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   ValueError: 'x' has to be smaller than 'y'!

``attrs`` ships with a bunch of validators, make sure to :ref:`check them out <api_validators>` before writing your own:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib(validator=attr.validators.instance_of(int))
   >>> C(42)
   C(x=42)
   >>> C("42")
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   TypeError: ("'x' must be <type 'int'> (got '42' that is a <type 'str'>).", Attribute(name='x', default=NOTHING, factory=NOTHING, validator=<instance_of validator for type <type 'int'>>), <type 'int'>, '42')

If you like `zope.interface <http://docs.zope.org/zope.interface/api.html#zope-interface-interface-specification>`_, ``attrs`` also comes with a :func:`attr.validators.provides` validator:

.. doctest::

   >>> import zope.interface
   >>> class IFoo(zope.interface.Interface):
   ...     def f():
   ...         """A function called f."""
   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib(validator=attr.validators.provides(IFoo))
   >>> C(x=object())
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   TypeError: ("'x' must provide <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo> which <object object at 0x10bafaaf0> doesn't.", Attribute(name='x', default=NOTHING, factory=NOTHING, validator=<provides validator for interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo>>), <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo>, <object object at 0x10bafaaf0>)
   >>> @zope.interface.implementer(IFoo)
   ... @attr.s
   ... class Foo(object):
   ...     def f(self):
   ...         print("hello, world")
   >>> C(Foo())
   C(x=Foo())

You can also disable them globally:

   >>> attr.set_run_validators(False)
   >>> C(42)
   C(x=42)
   >>> attr.set_run_validators(True)
   >>> C(42)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   TypeError: ("'x' must provide <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo> which 42 doesn't.", Attribute(name='x', default=NOTHING, validator=<provides validator for interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo>>, repr=True, cmp=True, hash=True, init=True), <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IFoo>, 42)


Conversion
----------

Attributes can have a ``convert`` function specified, which will be called with the attribute's passed-in value to get a new value to use.
This can be useful for doing type-conversions on values that you don't want to force your callers to do.

.. doctest::

    >>> @attr.s
    ... class C(object):
    ...     x = attr.ib(convert=int)
    >>> o = C("1")
    >>> o.x
    1

Converters are run *before* validators, so you can use validators to check the final form of the value.

.. doctest::

    >>> def validate_x(instance, attribute, value):
    ...     if value < 0:
    ...         raise ValueError("x must be be at least 0.")
    >>> @attr.s
    ... class C(object):
    ...     x = attr.ib(convert=int, validator=validate_x)
    >>> o = C("0")
    >>> o.x
    0
    >>> C("-1")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: x must be be at least 0.


.. _slots:

Slots
-----

By default, instances of classes have a dictionary for attribute storage.
This wastes space for objects having very few data attributes.
The space consumption can become significant when creating large numbers of instances.

Normal Python classes can avoid using a separate dictionary for each instance of a class by `defining <https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/datamodel.html#slots>`_ ``__slots__``.
For ``attrs`` classes it's enough to set ``slots=True``:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s(slots=True)
   ... class Coordinates(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   ...     y = attr.ib()


.. note::

    ``attrs`` slot classes can inherit from other classes just like non-slot classes, but some of the benefits of slot classes are lost if you do that.
    If you must inherit from other classes, try to inherit only from other slot classes.

Slot classes are a little different than ordinary, dictionary-backed classes:

- Assigning to a non-existent attribute of an instance will result in an ``AttributeError`` being raised.
  Depending on your needs, this might be a good thing since it will let you catch typos early.
  This is not the case if your class inherits from any non-slot classes.

  .. doctest::

     >>> @attr.s(slots=True)
     ... class Coordinates(object):
     ...     x = attr.ib()
     ...     y = attr.ib()
     ...
     >>> c = Coordinates(x=1, y=2)
     >>> c.z = 3
     Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
     AttributeError: 'Coordinates' object has no attribute 'z'

- Slot classes cannot share attribute names with their instances, while non-slot classes can.
  The following behaves differently if slot classes are used:

  .. doctest::

    >>> @attr.s
    ... class C(object):
    ...     x = attr.ib()
    >>> C.x
    Attribute(name='x', default=NOTHING, validator=None, repr=True, cmp=True, hash=True, init=True, convert=None)
    >>> @attr.s(slots=True)
    ... class C(object):
    ...     x = attr.ib()
    >>> C.x
    <member 'x' of 'C' objects>

- Since non-slot classes cannot be turned into slot classes after they have been created, ``attr.s(.., slots=True)`` will *replace* the class it is applied to with a copy.
  In almost all cases this isn't a problem, but we mention it for the sake of completeness.

- Using :mod:`pickle` with slot classes requires pickle protocol 2 or greater.
  Python 2 uses protocol 0 by default so the protocol needs to be specified.
  Python 3 uses protocol 3 by default.
  You can support protocol 0 and 1 by implementing :meth:`__getstate__ <object.__getstate__>` and :meth:`__setstate__ <object.__setstate__>` methods yourself.
  Those methods are created for frozen slot classes because they won't pickle otherwise.
  `Think twice <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KnfGDajDQw>`_ before using :mod:`pickle` though.

All in all, setting ``slots=True`` is usually a very good idea.


Immutability
------------

Sometimes you have instances that shouldn't be changed after instantiation.
Immutability is especially popular in functional programming and is generally a very good thing.
If you'd like to enforce it, ``attrs`` will try to help:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s(frozen=True)
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   >>> i = C(1)
   >>> i.x = 2
   Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
   attr.exceptions.FrozenInstanceError: can't set attribute
   >>> i.x
   1

Please note that true immutability is impossible in Python but it will :ref:`get <how-frozen>` you 99% there.
By themselves, immutable classes are useful for long-lived objects that should never change; like configurations for example.

In order to use them in regular program flow, you'll need a way to easily create new instances with changed attributes.
In Clojure that function is called `assoc <https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/assoc>`_ and ``attrs`` shamelessly imitates it: :func:`attr.assoc`:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s(frozen=True)
   ... class C(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   ...     y = attr.ib()
   >>> i1 = C(1, 2)
   >>> i1
   C(x=1, y=2)
   >>> i2 = attr.assoc(i1, y=3)
   >>> i2
   C(x=1, y=3)
   >>> i1 == i2
   False


Other Goodies
-------------

Sometimes you may want to create a class programmatically.
``attrs`` won't let you down and gives you :func:`attr.make_class` :

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C1(object):
   ...     x = attr.ib()
   ...     y = attr.ib()
   >>> C2 = attr.make_class("C2", ["x", "y"])
   >>> attr.fields(C1) == attr.fields(C2)
   True

You can still have power over the attributes if you pass a dictionary of name: ``attr.ib`` mappings and can pass arguments to ``@attr.s``:

.. doctest::

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", {"x": attr.ib(default=42),
   ...                           "y": attr.ib(default=attr.Factory(list))},
   ...                     repr=False)
   >>> i = C()
   >>> i  # no repr added!
   <attr._make.C object at ...>
   >>> i.x
   42
   >>> i.y
   []

Finally, you can exclude single attributes from certain methods:

.. doctest::

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class C(object):
   ...     user = attr.ib()
   ...     password = attr.ib(repr=False)
   >>> C("me", "s3kr3t")
   C(user='me')
